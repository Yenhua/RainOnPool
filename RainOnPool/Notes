Notes on obj coords:
Table height is from -0.5 to 0.5, so it has a length of 2
Translating all objects up 2 will make it look it is on top of it

on default camera view:
x is left and right, higher it is, further right
z is front/back, higher it is, closer up

Lights:
*Point
*Directional
*Ambient
*SpotLight on Bunny

If w is 0, x,y,z is a vector of directional light 
 Glfloat light_pos = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0} 
 
 Otherwise, it is position of point light 
 Glfloat light_pos = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0}
